# isPrime
An iOS app to check if a number is prime.

## Overview

The `isPrime` app allows users to input a number and instantly determine if it's prime. The core logic for checking primality is implemented in `ViewController.swift`.

## Features

- **Number Input**: Users can input any number to test its primality.
- **Instant Result**: Immediately after input, the app will indicate whether the number is prime or not.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sameersharma84/isPrime.git
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   
   Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file.

3. **Build & Run**:
   
   Simply press `Cmd + R` to build and run the app in the simulator or on a connected iOS device.

4. **Input a Number**:

   - Use the text field to input a number.
   - Press the "Check" button (not shown in the provided code, but assumed based on context).

5. **View the Result**:

   The app will display whether the number is prime right below the input field.

## Code Structure

- **ViewController**: Contains the main logic for the app, including:
  - `inputNumber`: Text field for number input.
  - `resultLabel`: Label to display the result.
  - `primeCheck(_:)`: Action triggered when the user wants to check the primality of a number.
